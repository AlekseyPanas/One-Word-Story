# One Word Story - **CSC207** project

## General Description

- A “One Word Story” local game intends to emulate an online game. Due to following 
*Clean Architecture* conventions, transforming this game in an online app is easily achievable, 
but we have made a conscious decision to focus on building the best functionality. 
- The game is played in the following way. One user opens the game, submits the
number of players, their names, certain game parameters, and the game starts for each player 
in a separate window. Players take timed turns submitting words, which contribute to the story. 
After a fixed number of rounds, the game ends and the story is complete.


## Contributors

Early on, we defined 4 core roles which were distributed among the group members. 
*Quality managers* are in charge of keeping track of proper testing, 
*Documentation managers* ensure documentation conventions are satisfied, 
*Architects* work on design, and *Coordinator* organizes/runs meetings and maintains 
GitHub Project management.
